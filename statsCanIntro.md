[Statistics Canada] (https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start) produce multiple updated tables every working day with datacovering a wide range of topics.     

Thanks to the [cansim package](https://github.com/mountainMath/cansim) developed by Jens von Bergmann and Dmitry Shkolnik  they are readily available.    

Listed below are today's tables. Clicking on a row will provide a set of 
variables used in the table which are used to construct example tables and charts
in the accompanying tabs. The full dataset can also be downloaded for further processing. _N.B. Some may be fairly large_
